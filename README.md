<i>A 2D pixel world full of potential and easy-to-read json data files.</i>

This project is in early stages, to simply get up to speed you can clone and 

``` node client.js ```

and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ where you will be informally prompted to log in with

<s>a password defined in client.js:33 (currently set to 'chu').</s>

Upon logging in, if the account does not exist, the user will be directed to a signup page (work in progress).
The data files included have an account 'name', with password 'pass'.
